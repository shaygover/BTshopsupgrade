Why only this mod got integration?
Because it includes a category list that tell me to what list this mech should be added. If you have a category list for another mod, open an issue on github. 

Categories: common, uncommon, rare, SLDF uncommon and SLDF rare. House categories are not required.

In this folder you can find the script I used to get the categories out of the mechdef files.
