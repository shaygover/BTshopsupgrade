## v0.1.0
- Initial release

## v0.1.1
- Too many items in shop. Reducing all high level counts to 70%, Higher probabilities to 140%

## v0.2.0
- Still to many. Reducing low level counts to 20% or 1. Amounts should be controlled from the high level (i.e. itemCollection_SLDF_lvl-# files). Reducing pirate counts to 8 (from 28).

## v0.2.1
- Too many items. Reducing low levels (1 and 2) to 1.

## v0.3.0
- Updated and should work with game version 1.9
- Added support for JK_Variants and LC_SLDFRoyal mechs by using the itemCollections in LC_SLDFRoyal_itemCollections. Which means it's now a dependency. 

## 0.3.2
- LC_SLDFRoyal created some unexpected crashes and weird behavior in game version 1.9.1. It's now removed as a dependency. JK_Variants should be OK. I'll add support for it later. 

## 0.4.0
- Added support for new items that were added to the game since the last time I did it (~08.2018).

## 0.4.2
- Added all advanced ammo types to lvl 3.

## 0.5.0
- Light mechs and mechparts were moved to another list.
