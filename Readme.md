## What the mod does
- light lvl-0: Adds light mech to shops in free worlds (Where the campaign begins).
Why? Because I don't see why anyone will use a light mech after Axilus. 
- lvl-1: Uncommon items from all factions (Except mechs and mechparts), common mechs and mechparts from all factions. Will show up in every Arano restoration star.
- lvl-2: Rare items from all factions (Except mechs and mechparts) and higher probabilities for common and uncommon items. Common SLDF weapons and limited ammo (LB#X, UAC and Narc). Stage 2 and forward. 
- lvl-3: Higher probabilities for lvl-1 and lvl-2 items and Gauss Rifle. Uncommon SLDF weapons and limited ammo (LB#X, UAC and Narc). Stage 3 and forward.
- lvl-4: uncommon mechs and mechparts, uncommon SLDF weapons, SLDF upgrades and mechparts. Rare SLDF weapons and limited ammo (LB#X, UAC and Narc).
- lvl-5: rare mechs and mechparts, rare SLDF weapons, better probabilities for SLDF upgrades. 
- lvl-6: better probabilities for lvl-4 and lvl-5 items.
- Also black market will get 8 random items from the lvl-6 list.

- Higher probabilities: 140%

## This mod make my game too easy!
- I know. That's the point. If you only want SLDF items in the shop, just tell me what exactly you want (What items and which stage).
- You can delete some files from the "starsystem" dir to remove the mod extra items from those stores. I suggest deleting everything but: Weldry, Panzyr, Smithon, Itrom, Tyrlon and Coromodir.
