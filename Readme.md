## This mod make my game too easy!
- I know. That's the point. If you only want SLDF items in the shop, just tell me what exactly you want (What items and which stage).
- You can delete some files from the "starsystem" dir to remove the mod extra items from those stores. I suggest deleting everything but: Weldry, Panzyr, Smithon, Itrom, Tyrlon and Coromodir.
